I constructed a day planner that would allow a busy employee to schedule their day on a normal 9 to 5 business hour basis. At the top is the current day and underneath are the available timeblocks in which you can type in different events and press the blue button to lock them in. As the day goes on current event timeblocks will appear in red, ones that have already passed will be presented in gray and future event timeblocks in green. This is another way besides the times presented to the left that the employee can keep track of their events.
